## Prerequisites

Here is what you will need on your journey:
* Past JavaScript/HTML expierience; CSS optional
* Basic knowledge on programming terminology
* Terminal usage knowledge -Optional-

If you are ready, let's continue!

J8D is now installed and ready to be used. Let's move on to the next section.

# Section II - Syntax
## Basic Syntax
All J8D variables and functions begin with the `j8` prefix. This is used to give immediate access to all functions and variables so required research is at a minimum.
### Functions
All function parameters in J8D have semi-strict types. Inputs like objects or lists are usually put in the `any` type.

That is really all you need to know about J8D syntax. It's pretty simple. Let's move on.

# Section III - Writing Our First Program

Let's get to writing our programs! You should have your `main.js` file opened in a code or text editor of your choice.

We start off with this code in the demo:
``` javascript

```
